# xml-wrangling
***
Using python, here I wrangle and explore geographical XML data from the MONDIAL Database. Techniques implemented in this project include:
+ Traversing and searching XML document trees using the ElementTree python library
+ Accessing and wrangling various data at multiple levels of the hierarchy
  + with code to handle and exclude missing data
+ Summarizing interesting metrics across:
  + countries, cities, ethnic groups, and geographical landscapes
+ Functional modularity
